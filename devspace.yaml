# `vars` specifies variables which may be used as ${VAR_NAME} in devspace.yaml
vars:
- name: REGISTRY_PASSWORD
  password: true

# `deployments` tells DevSpace how to deploy this project
deployments:
- name: kube-ns-suspender
  # This deployment uses `kubectl` but you can also define `helm` deployments
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - manifests/**

# `dev` only applies when you run `devspace dev`
dev:
  # `dev.sync` configures a file sync between our Pods in k8s and your local project files
  sync:
  - imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
    excludePaths:
    - .git/

  # `dev.terminal` tells DevSpace to open a terminal as a last step during `devspace dev`
  terminal:
    imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
    # With this optional `command` we can tell DevSpace to run a script when opening the terminal
    # This is often useful to display help info for new users or perform initial tasks (e.g. installing dependencies)
    # DevSpace has generated an example ./devspace_start.sh file in your local project - Feel free to customize it!
    command:
    - ./devspace_start.sh

  # Since our Helm charts and manifests deployments are often optimized for production,
  # DevSpace let's you swap out Pods dynamically to get a better dev environment
  replacePods:
  - imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
    # Since the `${IMAGE}` used to start our main application pod may be distroless or not have any dev tooling, let's replace it with a dev-optimized image
    # DevSpace provides a sample image here but you can use any image for your specific needs
    replaceImage: loftsh/go:latest
    # Besides replacing the container image, let's also apply some patches to the `spec` of our Pod
    # We are overwriting `command` + `args` for the first container in our selected Pod, so it starts with `sleep 9999999`
    # Using `sleep 9999999` as PID 1 (instead of the regular ENTRYPOINT), allows you to start the application manually
    patches:
    - op: replace
      path: spec.containers[0].command
      value:
      - sleep
    - op: replace
      path: spec.containers[0].args
      value:
      - "9999999"
    - op: remove
      path: spec.containers[0].securityContext

# `profiles` lets you modify the config above for different environments (e.g. dev vs production)
profiles:
  # This profile is called `production` and you can use it for example using: devspace deploy -p production
  # We generally recommend to use the base config without any profiles as optimized for development (e.g. image build+push is disabled)
- name: production
# This profile adds our image to the config so that DevSpace will build, tag and push our image before the deployment
  merge:
    images:
      app:
        image: ${IMAGE} # Use the value of our `${IMAGE}` variable here (see vars above)
